This cartoon represents the feelings associated
with the cultural signifance of the year 2020,
as well as what the public viewed as a disastorous
year. If the year was full of economic prosperity
and overall social happiness, 2020 would be a year 
to talk about for decades to come. Instead, a year
that was projected to be one of the best of the 
new millenium instead became one of the worst. Covid19,
presidential controversy, economic recession, near
complete government shutdown, and the fracturing of
of our country socially and politically contributed
to the public feeling remorse for the year we could've had.
As for the part of the cartoon that describes 2020 as
feeling fictional, the fact that all of the things described 
above occured in one single year is almost unheard of, 
especially in the modern day. It would easier to believe that
nothing happened in 2020 than to say what actually happend, which is what 
the cartoon is insinuating by removing the book 
entirely. I believe I feel this way from living through
the poor government response and online news and social media.
It's said that only the extreme viewpoint are present on the internet,
and with the majority of the population being forced to rely on the
internet for over a year, plenty of us have begun to view things in our country
with those same extreme viewpoints.
